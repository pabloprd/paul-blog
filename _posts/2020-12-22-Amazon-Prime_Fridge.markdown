“Francis I'm hungry” shouted the raspy voice of mother over the sound of the television. A
second-rate reality show was on, some rich bunch of tan bimbos arguing about trivialities. Francis
didn't mind, he barely paid attention to the sorry excuse of a plot. He had spent the last fifteen or so
minutes fantasizing about them, naked. It was a sad fact that none of those beautiful ladies would ever
know how good at sex he was. Way better then the meatheads they'd dated, at least. Francis sniffed and
scratched at his protruding belly, more cushion for the pushing.
“Francis! I know you can hear me”, his mother shouted again, “Make your poor mother some
lunch!”
Francis sighed with his whole body and started the process of peeling himself from the ragged
couch cushions. The half-chub he'd been nurturing pressed against his leg, uncomfortable and in the
way. The reality show switched to commercials. Just in time too, Francis was at the precipice of
collapsing back into the couch like a fallen tree. With a last burst of willpower he stood up, groaning all
the while.
“Shame on you Francis! After all I've done for you!” His mother shrieked, her raspy voice
becoming shrill. “Have you no decency left?! I swe-....”
“I'M ON MY WAY MA!!!!” Francis bellowed before she could finish. As if moving back home
wasn't punishment enough, now he was basically his mother's servant. Well, him and the nurse that
came once a week. Mother was a demanding menace even when she was healthy, but Francis could just
leave before. Now guilt anchored him to his mother's tiny apartment, that and the promise of
homelessness. Taking care of the same woman who had made the deli-assistant cry for a 5 cent
overcharge was no easy task. But that was life. When he finished his high fantasy novel he wouldn't
have to worry about anything anymore.
His mother, satiated with his response for the time being, remained quiet. Francis was able to
plod over the cheap linoleum floors and into the dirty kitchen in relative silence. Although, the car
horns and yelling of the New York streets still found their way into the room. Plates were piled high in
the sink. It fit in well with the aesthetic of the whole apartment. The whole placed had the sort of
dirtiness and filth that couldn't just be scrubbed out. A beaten down weariness inhabited the plaster of
the walls and the cheap furniture. As if each object and appliance was waiting for the day it would
break down so it could be thrown out into the much cheerier dump.
Francis waved away the flies as he searched for a plate clean enough not to arise suspicion. His
mother was bedridden after all, and he worked hard enough already. As an amateur philosopher he had
long ago realized the wisdom in not cleaning something if it was just going to get dirty again. He pulled
out a drawer and set a cutting board on top of it, making a makeshift table. Francis placed his picked
plate, with barely noticeable stains, on the board and turned towards the pristine refrigerator that stuck
out like a sore thumb.
It was a box of thin stainless steel, a gray obelisk in the ruin of his mother's low income
apartment. In the middle of the fridge was a touch screen not much bigger than a paper towel sheet.
Francis was reminded of the black monoliths from '2001 a space odyssey'. The rest of the kitchen was
like an ancient ruin, abandoned long ago, only recently colonized by the humming, beautiful, machine.
Mother had paid less then fifty bucks for the thing, same day delivery from Amazon as well. It
served as an Alexa, a tablet, and a fridge all in one. But it came at price. Francis felt the hatred well up
inside him like black fire. He tried to quash the rising feelings, knowing it would lead to nothing but
more suffering on his part. Francis glared at the hateful fridge like a criminal staring down the warden.
He took a reluctant step forward. Then he managed another. With effort he pushed himself into
a position where he was staring down into the black abyss of the tablet screen. Steeling himself for the
interaction he pressed his hand onto the tablet, cursing the refrigerator. The screen turned bright blue
and chirped as a thin white line descended on the screen under his hand, scanning it. As he took his
hand away the screen turned dark blue and displayed the smug, satisfied smirk of the Amazon prime
logo.

“Thank you for using the Amazon Prime Refrigerator” a vaguely synthetic female voice called
out from the speakers, “Brought to you by, the Nissan Altima, rated 2035's most fuel efficient car of the
year. And State Farm Insurance, like a good neighbor state farm is there.”
Francis grimaced to himself, even to boot up he had to listen to an advertisement. The screen
dissolved into a main menu where three tabs: 'Open Fridge', 'Settings', and 'Tablet', lay in bright white
lettering. In the top corner there was a white square that flashed out different products brought by the
Amazon marketplace. Francis pressed 'Open fridge' with his index finger, a small black box with a
loading screen popped up. Francis felt the stress build at the back of his skull like a small, growing
creature. He took a deep breath to calm himself down, there was no point in getting worked up, in a
few minutes it would all be over.
A mustached man in a yellow shirt and khakis appeared on the screen along with an ostrich of
similar apparel. They were on some sandy beach behind a volleyball net, sitting on lean plastic chairs.
“Now that we've helped so many people save money with Liberty mutual, we can finally get some
beach reading done!” the man stated proudly as he opened a nonsensical magazine. He erupted into
cascades of laughter before the screen faded to the tune of “Liberty, Liberty, Liberty”. Francis's face
sneered automatically. His body took what felt like physical damage as he saw the commercial reload.
“How about we try that again?” Alexa stated cheerfully, her feminine voice almost passive
aggressive. “This short commercial is scientifically proven to improve your mood. Try smiling along
with it. Amazon wants their customers to live happy and successful lives” Francis gritted his teeth, the
stress creature at the back of his mind grew. It was his own fault for being so dramatic, now he had cost
himself another extra minute.
The commercial played again and Francis widened his eyes and showed his teeth in a horrible
grimace that would trick the facial recognition system into thinking that he smiled. He damned the
mustached man to hell along with everyone who helped make the commercial.
“Thank you for your cooperation!” Alexa added cheerfully, right after the screen had faded to
black. Francis was taken to a new screen where there were only two tabs. One read “Have Alexa open
your fridge” and the other read “Open your fridge manually” in the same bright white lettering. The ad
box in the top corner remained in the same place. Francis selected the “Have Alexa open your fridge”
tab. From experience he knew the manual opening had a much longer commercial in store for him. The
screen faded and a prompt popped up with Amazon prime's signature smirk. Above it read “Ask Alexa
to open your fridge”.
“Alexa, open fridge.” Francis called out, hands on hips.
“Sorry, I didn't quite get that.”
“Alexa, OPEN FRIDGE” he spat through clenched teeth. Francis was certain there was a longer
pause between his statement and Alexa's response that followed.
“Sorry, I didn't quite get that.” She replied soothingly.
“ALEXA OPEN THE GODDAMN FRIDGE!!!!!!” Francis yelled as he gripped the sides of the
fridge.
“I've detected a hostile tone along with the use of profanity while interacting with an Amazon
product. Due to the inordinate amount of stress you are under please watch this short video from
Aurora Cannabis, the worlds #1 Cannabis supplier. Learn to Relax and take it easy with Aurora
Cannabis. Amazon cares about their customers, consider treating yourself with Aurora Cannabis, a
wide selection of strains and services for your relaxation needs.”
Francis sank to his knees and pressed his forehead against the cool metal of the fridge. A primal
scream was moments from erupting out of him, but he held his tongue for his own sake. The
commercial had begun to play for a split second before pausing because Alexa couldn't detect his eyes.
“Please return to viewing the screen so you can finish your video.” Alexa crooned from the
speakers like the mocking demon that she was. Francis didn't move from the floor, the desire to get his
mother food had slowly fallen behind the desire to not give Alexa what she wanted. A direct stream of

information into his brain that would slowly lock in all her commercials into his subconsciousness
forever. A few seconds passed, Alexa remained quiet,waiting for her prey's hunger to overtake its pride.
Francis turned and sat against the fridge, looking into the dismal apartment. The couch seemed so far
away, a distant land that promised comfort. He'd see commercials on the television, but at least he
didn't have to interact with them.
“Amazon prime fridge will enter sleep mode in the next thirty seconds.” Alexa called out,
spiteful she wasn't able to get what she wanted. Francis chuckled at the bottom of the fridge, out of
reach of Alexa's prying eyes. Annoying bitch. He enjoyed his small victory over her as he slid further
and further down onto the floor. A few more seconds passed. Silence.
Suddenly a shout came from his mother's bedroom. “Francis are you done yet? Hurry up! Are
you still on the couch?”
Francis shrieked internally with a force of pure anguish. “I'M STILL GETTING THE STUFF
OUT OF THE FRIDGE MA!” He scrabbled up to a standing position and let Alexa detect his face.
Three seconds to spare. His eyes felt dead and lifeless, he had lost to a machine and the machine knew
it. With a hatefully smug “Welcome back!” Alexa played the ad.
He watched the entire commercial, the smiling people danced in and out of his vision as they
held up the sponsored product. He tried to keep his mind blank, thinking of nothing except the
sandwich ingredients he would have to fish out from the shelves. Francis made sure to smile the entire
time, his mouth all teeth. At the end he smiled genuinely, imagining himself beating the people in the
commercial to a pulp. It lasted for sixty seconds. He knew there was one more commercial in store, a
fifteen second one. Then he was home-free.
The screen faded back into the prompt “Have Alexa open your fridge”. Francis took a deep
breath. He could do this. His tone would have to be loud, confident, and respectful if he wanted this to
be as painless as possible.
“Alexa! OPEN FRIDGE.” He bellowed, gripping the sides of the refrigerator.
“Of course!” She chirped, “This short video from Geico will be sure to brighten your day as I
make all the preparations to open your fridge!”
The screen buffered and brought up the picture of an office space with a camel walking through
it. “Guess what day it is!” the camel shouted in a goofy voice. Francis desperately held onto the fake
smile on his face. “Hahaha What day is it?”the camel asked again, ambling through an office of serious
and annoyed office workers. The camel stopped at the cubicle of a grim looking woman facing a
computer screen. His anthropomorphic face skewed itself into a devilish grin. The camel leaned its
long neck until it was almost brushing up against the woman. Francis could swear that the woman
trembled. “Leslie, guess what day it is?” the camel whispered. Without moving a muscle the woman
meekly replied “Hump day”. The camel exploded into laughter and galloped off into another section of
the office as a narrator began to speak. “How happy are customers that switch to Geico? About as
happy as a camel on Wednesday.”
The final commercial over the fridge door opened, bathing him in the glow of the fridge light.
Francis shivered, he'd rather die than go through that again today. Francis scoured for the ingredients
for the sandwich; tomato, onion, pickles, salami, mayonnaise, lettuce. Fortunately, all of the ingredients
were towards the front of the fridge and easily picked out. It seemed his luck had turned, he was able to
gather the whole list of ingredients before the fridge timed out and closed on him.
He spread the ingredients on the plate he had left on the counter, chopping up the tomatoes and
onions as the fridge sealed behind him. But as he prepared the ingredients, he realized he couldn't find
any bread. Francis checked the bread basket, the cupboards and even the drawers but he wasn't able to
find a crumb. Cursing to himself he looked in the spice drawer and even where his mother kept pots
and pans, but to no avail. He was sure that they had bread, he'd had some the night before. Unless the
nurse had stolen it in the morning, which was unlikely.
“Ma!”, he shouted towards his mother's bedroom, “Do you know where the bread is?”

“Yeah! The nurse said it was going bad so I asked her to put it towards the back of the fridge.”
